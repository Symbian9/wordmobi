= Next feature to be implemented =

 # Image resizing before upload to save bandwidth/upload time
 # access point persistence
 # upload to flickr
 # multiple twitter accounts (one twitter account per blog)
 # Summary in statistics dialog (number os posts, number of comments, number of new comments and so on)

= Future enhancements and ideas =

 # Would it be possible to add option for upload post as private? I suggest add one option publish/savedraft/private. [issue #71]
 # Change background color, font color and maybe font when editing a new post.
 # "test connection" option in access point selection/proxy/twitter setup
 # to upload also movies and other kind of files to his / her wordpress blog. There are many live-streaming apps allowing you to post / stream video directly from your mobile (CellSpin, Qik, LiveCliq, Flixwagon), but none of them is really helping when it comes to edit text or to arrange the post page.
 # Also adding .pdf or .doc to your webbased wordpress blog
 # Image selection with thumbnails support
 # Avoid app to be terminates when the red key is pressed
 # Icons for indicating the post status: draft, local, edited or just remote
 # blogger support
 # Default button label customizations with uikludges/uitricks
 # html support when editing comments
 # better icon for "about" menu entry
 # calendar view, showing days with posts
 # preview option in other places, like post title window, not only inside post contents
 # allow categories inclusion inside post edit window
 # sub categories support
 # search in posts
 # batch operations (multiple selection for deleting and approving, for instance)
 # create a css for better post preview
 # add title in html (post preview)
 # better exception handler, providing more elucidative messages
 # retry option when uploading images
 # custom entries for html formatting.I think it is possible to add this option and make the blogger life easier with all their tags already coded in some "custom" menu.
 # better camera support when taking photos
 # Offline comments
 # Offline category/TAGs creation
 # Edit permalinks
 # Threaded comment
