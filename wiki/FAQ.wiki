The best thing to do in such situation is running the scripts. Download the source code for your version e run wormobi from scripts. The download may be done [http://code.google.com/p/wordmobi/source/checkout using subversion] or file by file, using the [http://code.google.com/p/wordmobi/source/browse/#svn/trunk/wordmobi/src source code browser]. 

Afterward, do the following:

 # Install python and python shell, version 1.4.5
 # In our memory card, create directories e:\python and e:\python\lib
 # Remove or comment the line at the end of window.py with the folowwing text: "app.set_exit()". For commenting, just put # at the beginning, like #app.set_exit().
 # Copy all files into e:\python\lib, except default.py
 # Copy default.py into e:\python\
 # Run default.py via python shell, opening Python and selecting "Option->Run script"

This way, it will be possible to see the error messages or to add logs and alerts during execution. Please, collect these log messages and send them to developers.
