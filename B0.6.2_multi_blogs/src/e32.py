wxPython emulation of e32 module from Python for S60

This module emulates the e32 functionality for testing and emulating
Symbian applications on a desktop.

Unlike the original e32, this one depends on appuifw.
"""

# Configurations tested (all with unicode enabled):
#  * Mac OS X 10.4 with wxPython 2.5.3.1
#  * Linux with wxPython 2.5.3.1, 2.5.4, 2.6.1.0
#  * Windows with wxPython 2.5.3.1
